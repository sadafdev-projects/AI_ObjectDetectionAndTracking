# 🎯 Object Detection and Tracking

## 📖 Overview
This project implements a real-time Object Detection and Tracking system using OpenCV and deep learning models such as YOLO or Faster R-CNN.  
It detects multiple objects in live video or pre-recorded footage and tracks their movement using algorithms like SORT or Deep SORT.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time object detection from webcam or video file  
- Uses pre-trained models (YOLO / Faster R-CNN) for high accuracy  
- Tracks detected objects using SORT or Deep SORT algorithms  
- Displays bounding boxes, labels, and tracking IDs  
- Efficient and easy to customize for different datasets  

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- TensorFlow / PyTorch  
- NumPy  
- Deep SORT / SORT algorithms  

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Capture real-time video input (webcam or file).  
2. Process each frame through a deep learning model for object detection.  
3. Extract detected objects’ bounding boxes and class labels.  
4. Track objects across frames using SORT/Deep SORT.  
5. Display the output with bounding boxes and tracking IDs.  

## 🧩 Optional Enhancements
- Save output video with detection and tracking overlays.  
- Add counting or speed estimation features.  
- Use custom-trained detection models for specific applications.
