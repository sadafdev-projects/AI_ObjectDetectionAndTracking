# AI_ObjectDetectionAndTracking
This project implements a real-time Object Detection and Tracking system using OpenCV and deep learning models such as YOLO or Faster R-CNN. It detects multiple objects in live video or pre-recorded footage and tracks their movement using algorithms like SORT or Deep SORT.
